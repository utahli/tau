title: "Phase 20.2: Thinking Mode Controls"
---

Phase 20.2 makes thinking mode an explicit Tau coding-session setting and adds
a TUI control for changing it.

## What Was Added

`tau_coding.thinking` defines Tau's supported thinking modes:

```text
off
minimal
low
medium
high
xhigh
```

The default is `medium`, matching Pi's default reasoning-depth preference. Tau
validates the visible controls against provider/model capabilities and passes
OpenAI-compatible `reasoning_effort` when a configured provider declares support.
Unsupported models show thinking controls as unavailable instead of presenting a
mode that Tau cannot safely send.

## Session Persistence

New sessions append an initial `thinking_level_change` entry after the initial
model entry. Explicit changes append another `thinking_level_change` entry. As
the last non-legacy-leaf entry, it becomes the active tip, so resume reconstructs
the active thinking mode from the session tree.

`CodingSession` exposes:

```python
session.thinking_level
session.available_thinking_levels
await session.set_thinking_level("high")
await session.cycle_thinking_level()
```

This keeps thinking state in `tau_coding`, while `tau_agent.session` remains the
portable replay layer that knows how to reconstruct `ThinkingLevelChangeEntry`
values.

## Commands And TUI

The Textual TUI binds thinking cycling to `Shift-Tab` by default. The key is
configurable in `~/.tau/tui.json`:

```json
{
  "keybindings": {
    "thinking_cycle": "f3"
  }
}
```

The sidebar and compact session line read `session.available_thinking_levels`
first. When the active provider or model has no thinking capability metadata,
the TUI shows the control as unavailable. If the user tries to cycle or set a
thinking mode anyway, the session raises a user-facing reason.

Tau does not register a standalone `/thinking` command in the default command
registry. The command surface stays aligned with Pi/Codex, where model choice
and reasoning controls belong with model selection and session status. `/session`
reports `Thinking mode: unavailable` plus the reason when the active
provider/model cannot change thinking mode.

## Provider Capabilities

Provider settings may declare thinking support with:

```json
{
  "thinking_levels": ["off", "low", "medium", "high"],
  "thinking_models": ["gpt-5.5"],
  "thinking_default": "medium",
  "thinking_parameter": "reasoning_effort"
}
```

`thinking_models` is optional. If it is omitted, the declared levels apply to
all models for that provider. Tau's built-in providers declare thinking support
only for models whose reasoning controls were checked when the model was added.
When adding new catalog models, validate the provider docs/API first and update
`thinking_models` only for models that actually support Tau's configured
thinking parameter.

The supported parameter mappings are:

- `reasoning_effort`: top-level OpenAI-compatible chat-completions field.
- `reasoning.effort`: nested Responses API shape, sent as
  `{ "reasoning": { "effort": "...", "summary": "auto" } }` for provider
  configs that explicitly opt into it.
- `anthropic.thinking`: Anthropic extended thinking, sent as
  `{ "thinking": { "type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": ... } }`.

Tau records an explicit reason when controls are unavailable:

- Providers with no `thinking_levels` report that the provider does not declare
  thinking capability metadata.
- Providers with `thinking_models` report that the active model is not listed
  when the model is outside that capability set.
- Provider-specific configs use the mapped runtime parameter above when the
  active model is declared as capable.

This keeps the durable provider metadata in `tau_coding`, the provider-specific
runtime knob in `tau_ai`, and the display choice in CLI/TUI code.

## Provider Comparison

OpenAI's public API exposes `reasoning_effort` for chat completions and
`reasoning.effort` for Responses API reasoning models. Supported values are
model-dependent; current docs list `none`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`,
and `xhigh`, with defaults and support varying by model. Tau's direct OpenAI
entry maps Tau's normalized levels to `reasoning_effort` only for configured
reasoning-capable models.

Codex clients expose `model_reasoning_effort` for supported models. Tau mirrors
Pi's Codex subscription mapping: `off` omits the `reasoning` field, `minimal`
requests `low`, and enabled levels send `reasoning.effort` with
`reasoning.summary: "auto"`. Built-in `openai-codex` models declare this support
only for the validated GPT-5.x Codex model list.

Anthropic has used both explicit extended-thinking token budgets and newer
adaptive/effort controls, with support changing by model family. Tau maps its
normalized thinking levels to explicit Anthropic `budget_tokens` for the
built-in Claude models that declare extended-thinking support. `off` omits the
`thinking` payload.

Models or providers without declared capability metadata are treated as having
no configurable thinking mode. Their existing session thinking setting is kept
while controls are hidden, so switching back to a capable model can reuse that
setting when it is valid. If a capable target model does not support the current
level, Tau coerces to that model/provider default.

## Boundary

Thinking controls remain outside Textual-specific rendering. Provider adapters
translate supported reasoning streams into provider-neutral thinking events,
`tau_agent` forwards those events without recording them as durable assistant
messages, and the Textual TUI decides whether to show or hide them. The built-in
TUI hides thinking tokens by default and exposes `Ctrl+T` as a frontend toggle.

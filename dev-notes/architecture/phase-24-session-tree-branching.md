title: "Phase 24: Session Tree Branching"
---

This phase exposes Tau's existing append-only session tree in the Textual TUI.
It follows Pi's core behavior: moving through the tree is a structural session
mutation, not a transcript edit.

## What Changed

`/tree` opens a modal tree picker for the active session. The picker lists
branchable conversation entries near their parent branch point, with small
indentation only where the session history has diverged into alternate branches,
marks the active leaf, and supports two actions:

- `Enter` moves the active leaf to the selected entry.
- `S` moves the active leaf through a new `branch_summary` entry.
- `Ctrl+T` toggles tool-call entries on or off for easier navigation in
  tool-heavy histories.

Both actions preserve all existing JSONL entries. Plain navigation is in-memory
only. If the user quits immediately, reopening selects the last non-legacy-leaf
entry in file order rather than restoring that uncommitted selection. The next
message or state change is appended with the selected target as its parent and
therefore makes the new branch durable. Summary navigation appends its
`branch_summary` immediately, so that summary becomes the durable tip. The
picker intentionally hides metadata entries such as model changes,
thinking-level changes, historical leaf pointers, and session info; it only
shows user messages, assistant messages, tool calls, compaction summaries, and
branch summaries.

## Branch Summaries

Tau already had a `BranchSummaryEntry` type. This phase makes it replay-aware:
when the active root-to-leaf path contains a branch summary, `SessionState`
converts it into a user-context summary message.

Branch summaries now use the active provider and model to summarize active-path
messages after the selected entry. `CodingSession` sends a one-off summarization
request outside the main `AgentHarness` transcript, using a Pi-style structured
summary prompt with sections for goal, constraints, progress, decisions, and
next steps. The TUI supports both the default prompt and per-branch custom
focus instructions. Tau stores the resulting text in the existing
`BranchSummaryEntry` shape. If the provider returns no usable text, reports an
error, or raises, Tau falls back to the same deterministic summary helper used
by automatic compaction.

## Boundaries

`tau_agent.session` owns generic replay semantics for `branch_summary` entries.
`tau_coding.CodingSession` owns branch navigation, model summary creation,
fallback summary creation, storage mutation, and harness message replacement.
The Textual TUI only displays choices and calls the session method selected by
the user.

## Validation

Useful checks:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_session.py tests/test_coding_session.py tests/test_commands.py tests/test_tui_app.py -q
uv run ruff check src/tau_agent/session/memory.py src/tau_coding/session.py src/tau_coding/commands.py src/tau_coding/tui/app.py tests/test_session.py tests/test_coding_session.py tests/test_commands.py tests/test_tui_app.py
```

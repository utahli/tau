title: "Provider Retry Events"
---

Tau retries transient provider failures in `tau_ai`, where HTTP status codes and
transport exceptions are visible. This keeps retry classification out of
`tau_agent` while still allowing the portable agent loop to surface progress.

## What Was Added

Provider adapters can emit `ProviderRetryEvent` before retrying a failed request.
The event includes the next attempt number, total attempts, delay, a
human-readable message, and structured diagnostic data.

`run_agent_loop()` maps that provider event to `RetryEvent`, a provider-neutral
agent event consumed by renderers and TUI adapters.

## Behavior

OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic, and OpenAI Codex subscription providers retry
transient status codes such as `408`, `409`, `429`, and `5xx` responses before
surfacing a final provider error. The default is two retries, for three total
request attempts.

The Anthropic and OpenAI Codex adapters also retry transient *in-stream*
failures. Both APIs can return HTTP 200 and then send an SSE error event. For
Anthropic, retryable error types are `api_error`, `overloaded_error`, and
`rate_limit_error`. Codex classifies `error` and `response.failed` events against
transient markers such as overloaded, service unavailable, rate limit,
internal/server errors, and timeouts.

When an in-stream error arrives before content or thinking deltas, the adapter
emits `ProviderRetryEvent` and reissues the request under the same `max_retries`
budget. Errors after partial content, and non-transient errors such as
`authentication_error` or `invalid_api_key`, stay terminal to avoid replaying
visible output or tool calls.

Backoff is short, exponential, and capped by `max_retry_delay_seconds`.
Cancellation is checked during the backoff delay so Escape/TUI cancellation does
not wait for the entire retry sleep to finish.

## Rendering

Transcript and TUI renderers show retry progress as subtle status output. Final
text mode ignores retry progress and only prints the final assistant response or
final error.

## Boundary

`tau_agent` does not decide whether an HTTP response is retryable. It only
forwards `RetryEvent` as portable progress. Provider-specific details stay in
the adapter's `data` payload for diagnostics.

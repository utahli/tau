# Pi-Compatible First-Kept Compaction

## What changed

Tau compactions now persist `first_kept_entry_id`, the id of the first active-path
entry retained after the summarized prefix. The boundary may be a metadata entry that does
not itself produce a message. Fresh JSONL records omit the empty legacy `replaces_entry_ids`
field. The persisted cost is therefore constant instead of growing by one id for every
summarized entry.

`CompactionPlan` carries the boundary and a transient replaced-entry count. The count keeps
manual status text accurate without storing all replaced ids. Manual, threshold, and
overflow compaction all use the same recent-preserving plan, record the pre-compaction token
estimate, and do not write a compaction unless it has a real retained boundary.

## Replay semantics

Replay follows the active root-to-leaf path. At a modern compaction it produces:

```text
[summary] + [first kept message ... messages before compaction] + [successor messages]
```

The boundary is inclusive and is resolved against every entry on the active path, including
metadata and earlier compaction entries; only context-producing entries become messages. If
a hand-edited or boundary-less entry has no resolvable kept id, the pre-compaction result is
only the summary; normal path replay still adds successors written after that compaction.
This matches Pi's historical `firstKeptEntryId` behavior.

Tau applies compactions while walking the selected path, so branches not on that path never
influence the boundary lookup. A boundary at the first, middle, or final active message is
covered deterministically.

## Legacy compatibility

Older Tau versions persisted `replaces_entry_ids`, including records that also have a
`first_kept_entry_id`. An explicitly stored legacy list deliberately takes precedence, even
when it is empty. That preserves the old set-based behavior, including arbitrary non-prefix
replacement sets and summaries inserted at the first replaced position. The field remains
accepted by the strict Pydantic discriminated union and is omitted from fresh records when
it was not supplied.

RPC session inspection no longer emits `replacesEntryIds` or
`details.tauReplacedEntryIds`. Modern entries map directly to Pi's compaction shape. Legacy
entries without the complete Pi boundary/token pair remain `tau.compaction` custom records
with their summary, while local replay continues to honor the private compatibility field.
HTML export displays the first-kept boundary rather than the replaced-id list; raw JSONL
exports retain legacy data.

## Why this belongs at these layers

- `tau_agent` owns entry compatibility and deterministic replay.
- `tau_coding` owns compaction planning, status text, RPC projection, and HTML presentation.

This keeps the portable harness independent of CLI and rendering policy while preserving
Tau's append-only session history.

## Validation

Focused coverage lives in `tests/test_session.py`, `tests/test_coding_session.py`,
`tests/test_rpc.py`, and `tests/test_session_export.py`. The legacy fixture is
`tests/fixtures/legacy_compaction.jsonl`.

# Tau architecture

Tau preserves Pi's separation of concerns:

```text
AgentHarness = reusable agent brain
AgentSession = coding-agent environment
TUI = one possible frontend
```

Packages:

- `tau_ai`: provider/model streaming and provider-neutral events.
- `tau_agent`: portable harness, loop, tools, messages, events, and sessions.
- `tau_coding`: CLI application, resources, skills, extensions, commands, persistence, rendering, and TUI integration.

Keep `tau_agent` independent of Typer, Rich, Textual, application resource locations, and provider-specific assumptions. Prefer typed data models, explicit async boundaries, deterministic fakes, and small abstractions.

Dynamic provider contracts and composition belong to `tau_coding.extensions`.
Every staged `ExtensionRuntime` owns a fresh source/generation/layer-aware
`DynamicProviderRegistry`; durable `ProviderConfig` objects are immutable baseline
inputs. Dynamic source identity is host-owned and canonical-entry-path-based, not an
extension display name. Discovery freezes all source IDs before extension import;
setup and cleanup use only that stored identity even if extension code retargets a
symlink. The registry is frontend-free and process-local. Retirement
atomically invalidates dynamic layers and removes cancelled operations from
coalescing. Discovery receives one task cancellation; async close waits at most
0.25 seconds from that request without cancelling `finally` cleanup again. A task
still running is explicitly contained, not drained, and a process-owned supervisor
keeps its task and registry reachable until completion under stale-publication guards.
Reload and session replacement contain cancellation after publication until this
outgoing drain/containment step finishes, then return the adopted result. Before
publication, a replacement owns and closes its candidate providers on cancellation
or failure without closing the active provider; successful adoption transfers that
ledger once. Final close uses one durable task and propagates cancellation only after
discharging its registry and every provider exactly once. OpenAI-compatible dynamic
runtimes reuse
`tau_ai.OpenAICompatibleProvider` through an explicit transport
choice, so model names cannot silently select another endpoint API.

The local-backend contract is another `tau_coding` boundary. A staged runtime
owns a `LocalBackendRegistry` beside its provider registry. Each backend is
bound to the exact source-owned provider layer and generation that registered it;
this prevents a shadowing source from using or resetting another source's
integration. Backends return typed configuration, status, action, diagnostic,
and progress values. The registry supervises in-flight work and permits a new
frontend screen to observe its latest progress without restarting the backend
operation. The Textual adapter renders those values and owns cancellation,
confirmation, and idle checks. No local-backend or Textual code
belongs in `tau_agent` or `tau_ai`.

Phase 6 validates the boundary with a permanent second fake backend and a
test-only Ollama adapter. An adapter may use separate provider-discovery and
backend-status endpoints, expose installed/running state through generic model
state, and use `NoAuth`; none of those cases require llama.cpp concepts in the
contract. Refresh cancellation is bounded and generation-safe, and a late
operation cannot publish after retirement. Router mutations remain a later
phase.

In a Tau checkout, read `AGENTS.md`, `website/content/internals/architecture.md`, and relevant `dev-notes/architecture/` documents before broad architectural changes.

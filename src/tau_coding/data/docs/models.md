# Tau providers and models

A provider hosts models; a model is the exact ID accepted by that provider. Use
`/login` for durable built-in credentials and `/model` to choose an available
model.

## Built-in llama.cpp

Tau includes a trusted, hidden `llama.cpp` provider layer for local inference.
Configure it in the TUI with `/local`, not `/login custom`:

```text
/local
```

The backend is recommended and preselected, but the selection is explicit. It
accepts a server URL with or without `/v1`, discovers real IDs from `/v1/models`,
and supports optional, environment, or absent authentication. No fake key or
fake model value is used. See `local-inference.md` for server setup, cache,
troubleshooting, Doctor, and reset behavior.

After setup, choose models in `/model` or start explicitly:

```bash
tau --provider llama.cpp --model <server-reported-id>
tau --provider llama.cpp --model <server-reported-id> --print "summarize this project"
```

The built-in provider is dynamic and process-local. Its safe endpoint/model
snapshot is stored under `~/.tau/state/extensions/llama.cpp.json`; its optional
secret is stored separately in `~/.tau/credentials.json`. Dynamic definitions
are never copied into `catalog.toml`, `providers.json`, or session files. A
cached snapshot can keep an explicit startup usable during temporary server
downtime. An unavailable local backend is never an implicit fallback for a new
ordinary session.

## Durable and dynamic providers

Catalog providers are durable user/application configuration. Extension provider
layers are source- and generation-owned overlays held only by an active
`ExtensionRuntime`. Their definitions and refresh snapshots are not persisted as
durable provider configuration. Removing a dynamic layer restores the complete
preceding layer or the durable baseline.

Dynamic providers support required, optional, or absent authentication without
fake keys. Secrets resolve immediately before refresh or runtime creation and are
excluded from representations, diagnostics, snapshots, sessions, and exports.
The contract is validated by a permanent second fake backend and a test-only
Ollama adapter; Ollama is not a shipped Tau backend.

Trusted built-in llama.cpp models may persist as scoped references containing
only provider ID plus exact model ID. Loaded/sleeping references are selectable.
An unloaded or missing reference remains visible as unavailable and inert: it
cannot create dynamic metadata, perform network discovery, or trigger a router
mutation. User/project dynamic providers cannot persist scoped references.

## Existing custom providers

Other OpenAI-compatible endpoints can still be configured with `/login custom`,
`tau setup`, or a user-level `~/.tau/catalog.toml` entry. That path is useful for
Ollama, gateways, and older manually configured local providers. An existing
provider named `llama-cpp` remains distinct from the built-in `llama.cpp`; Tau
does not migrate or overwrite it.

## Metadata and selection rules

Use exact provider/model IDs. Tau does not infer context windows, output limits,
reasoning support, modalities, pricing, or tool compatibility when a server does
not report them. Local Doctor can verify streaming and tool-call behavior only
when explicitly requested. If a refreshed server no longer reports the active
model, Tau keeps the current runtime usable and marks the model snapshot stale;
it does not silently replace the model.

Provider/model selection precedence is explicit CLI selection, the resumed
transcript's provider-aware model entry, the session record for legacy sessions,
a durable default, and then a usable durable provider. Dynamic local providers
are selected only by explicit startup, a resumed local session, or an in-session
`/model`/`/local` action. The old `llama-cpp` catalog provider is not migrated;
configure the built-in `llama.cpp` layer separately through `/local`.

## Hugging Face routing

Hugging Face routing has two session modes. Automatic mode keeps the provider
from the first successful response as a sticky route, but retries once through
unsuffixed routing after that route exhausts retryable pre-output HTTP failures.
A configured or extension-selected provider is fixed and never silently
overridden. The external Hugging Face extension controls these modes with
`/hf route`; core owns safe continuation, persistence, and reroute diagnostics.

## Changing the built-in catalog

Tau follows Pi's build-time model-generation design. Provider transports,
authentication, defaults, compatibility corrections, and fallback model rows
live in `src/tau_coding/data/catalog.toml`. Complete model inventories and
models.dev-owned metadata live in the checked-in
`data/models-dev-catalog.json`. Refresh that snapshot with:

```bash
uv run python scripts/generate_models.py
```

Generation includes non-deprecated, tool-capable text models and copies names,
reasoning support, modalities, costs, context limits, output limits, and verified
effort values. New source models therefore require no hand edit to the inventory.
Verify transports and narrow corrections against official provider documentation;
never guess them.

Tau thinking levels match Pi: `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`,
`xhigh`, and `max`. `none` becomes `off`; `max` remains distinct from `xhigh`.
Empty or toggle-only reasoning options produce no generated override, matching
Pi. Provider/manual behavior remains in effect for those models.

Tau also refreshes catalogs like Pi. Opening `/model` shows the current snapshot
immediately and refreshes in the background. `tau update --models` forces a
refresh. Results are ETag-revalidated, throttled to four hours, and cached at
`~/.tau/models-store.json`; a cache applies only when newer than the bundled
snapshot. Since Tau has no hosted catalog service, it fetches models.dev and
NVIDIA directly and transforms them locally.

The `openai-codex` provider is different: its inventory is account-specific.
When Codex OAuth is configured, Tau loads the last successful account-matched
snapshot from `~/.tau/codex-models-store.json` at startup. This makes a model
that was discovered in an earlier session available immediately. Opening
`/model` or `/scoped-models` refreshes the authenticated Codex `/models` catalog
in the background. Because that endpoint filters models by official-client
version, Tau first resolves the current stable `@openai/codex` release from the
npm registry. The version lookup is ETag-revalidated, throttled to four hours,
and cached at `~/.tau/codex-version-store.json`; a stale cached or bundled
version is the non-fatal fallback. This lets newly gated models appear without a
Tau release.

A successful live snapshot replaces the checked-in Codex inventory for that
process and supplies model names, input modalities, reasoning efforts, and
runtime limits. Tau persists only parsed model metadata and the account ID, not
OAuth tokens. The cache is never merged into `catalog.toml`, `providers.json`,
or the models.dev cache. A different account does not use the previous
account's snapshot. Missing credentials, malformed data, or network failures
retain the account-matched snapshot or static Codex fallback.
`TAU_OFFLINE=1` disables catalog network access and permits only the cached or
bundled data.

Explicit startup and resume of a Codex model absent from the static catalog
perform authenticated discovery before model validation. Such live-only selections
require successful discovery; offline startup still supports static models.
If a refreshed inventory omits the active model, its existing runtime metadata
remains usable without restoring that model to the picker. Resume restores the
transcript's model selection, not the model from the session being left. If an
older session has a stale saved selection, resume it and explicitly select the
intended model in `/model` to record the correction.

Static-model startup never requires network. Missing, invalid, or incompatible generated or
cached data falls back silently to `catalog.toml`. User `~/.tau/catalog.toml`
overlays are applied last. When withdrawing one provider's model, add it to that
provider's `removed_models` list so stale user overlays cannot restore it.

Update `website/content/guides/providers-and-models.md` and a development note
for substantial changes. Run focused provider tests, full pytest, Ruff,
formatting, mypy, and the website build when published docs change.

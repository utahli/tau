title: Providers & models
description: Connect OAuth subscriptions, API-key providers, or a local model — and switch models any time.
---

A **provider** is the service hosting AI models; a **model** is the specific one
you talk to. Tau ships with several built-in providers and lets you add your own
OpenAI-compatible endpoints (including local models).

## The fastest setup: `/login`

Start Tau and use `/login` to connect a provider. The provider picker includes
a search field, which is especially useful for the longer API-key provider list:

```bash
tau
```

```text
/login              # choose a login method
/login openai       # save an OpenAI API key
/login openai-codex # authenticate a Codex/ChatGPT subscription via OAuth
/login anthropic-subscription # authenticate Claude Pro/Max via OAuth
/login anthropic-api # save an Anthropic API key
/login github-copilot # authenticate GitHub Copilot with a device code
/login opencode-go  # save an OpenCode Go API key
/login nvidia       # save an NVIDIA NIM API key
/login custom       # add an OpenAI-compatible custom provider
```

Built-in providers include **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, **OpenAI Codex**
(subscription), **GitHub Copilot**, **OpenCode Go**, **OpenCode Zen**,
**Moonshot AI (Kimi)**, **Kimi Code** (subscription), **OpenRouter**, **Hugging Face**,
and **NVIDIA NIM**.

### OAuth subscriptions

Choose **Subscription / OAuth** in `/login` for:

| Tau provider | Login flow | Prerequisite |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `openai-codex` | Browser callback with pasted-code fallback | A supported ChatGPT/Codex subscription |
| `anthropic` | Browser callback with PKCE and pasted-code fallback | Claude Pro/Max with Anthropic extra usage available |
| `github-copilot` | GitHub device code | An active Copilot plan; organization policy must allow the selected model |

GitHub Copilot asks for a GitHub Enterprise Server URL/domain. Leave it blank
for `github.com`. Device login also works in SSH/headless sessions: open the
shown verification URL on any device and enter the displayed code.

Anthropic uses distinct direct-login aliases so the authentication method is
unambiguous: `/login anthropic-subscription` starts OAuth, while
`/login anthropic-api` saves an API key. The top-level `/login` picker still
lists Anthropic under both **Subscription / OAuth** and **API key**. OAuth
subscription requests use Anthropic's required
Claude Code identity and may be billed as extra usage rather than consuming
ordinary Claude plan limits. Check Anthropic's current account terms before
using it.

OAuth tokens refresh automatically. `/logout` removes Tau's local credential,
but does not revoke the grant remotely; use the provider's account settings for
remote revocation.

#### OpenAI prompt caching

For direct OpenAI API and Codex OAuth sessions, Tau sends a stable session-derived
prompt-cache key with every model request, including continuations after tool
calls. OpenAI can use that key to keep successive append-only requests on the same
cache path, improving reuse of the system prompt, tool schemas, and conversation
prefix. Resuming a Tau session reuses its key; starting or branching a session
creates a new one.

Requests remain stateless: Tau keeps provider storage disabled and resends the
complete transcript. The key improves cache affinity but cannot preserve a hit if
the prefix changes or the provider cache expires. OpenAI-compatible gateways do
not receive these fields unless their catalog compatibility settings explicitly
opt in. The TUI sidebar's latest-request cache rate shows whether the most recent
request actually hit.

#### Anthropic prompt caching

Tau marks cache breakpoints on Anthropic requests so the system prompt, tool
schemas, and conversation history are reused between turns instead of being
reprocessed. Which retention Tau asks for depends on how you authenticated:

- **Claude Pro/Max via OAuth** requests the one-hour cache. Subscription auth is
  not billed per token, and the five-minute default is shorter than a build, a
  test run, or the time it takes to read a diff — any of which would otherwise
  expire the cache mid-session.
- **An Anthropic API key** uses the five-minute default, because one-hour cache
  writes cost more per token and that should be a deliberate choice.

Providers that speak the Anthropic protocol through a gateway rather than being
Anthropic itself — `minimax`, `minimax-cn`, `fireworks`, and `vercel-ai-gateway` —
send no cache breakpoints, since not every gateway accepts them. Watch the
sidebar's cache hit rate to see caching working; see
[The interactive session]({{< relref "./tui.md" >}}) for how to read it.

#### Codex subscription context limits

OpenAI's public API and the ChatGPT/Codex subscription are separate serving
surfaces. A model with the same ID can have a smaller, rollout-specific context
window through Codex OAuth than through an API key. For example, the public
GPT-5.6 Sol API advertises a 1.05M-token window, while Codex has advertised
substantially smaller limits through its authenticated model catalog.

Tau queries that catalog when a Codex session starts and uses the returned
context window and automatic-compaction threshold for the session. If discovery
is unavailable, Tau falls back to conservative Codex-specific values from its
built-in catalog; it does not reuse the public API limit. `/session` reports both
the active value and whether it came from the live provider catalog or Tau's
configured fallback.

Live limits can vary by account or rollout and may change independently of Tau.
A discovery failure is non-fatal: Tau reports it in `/session` and continues with
the fallback. Direct OpenAI API sessions retain the context limits documented on
the API model page. Vision-capable Codex models retain their image-input
metadata separately from these runtime context limits, allowing image files read
by Tau to reach the model. The `gpt-5.6` alias, which routes to GPT-5.6 Sol, is only
available through the direct OpenAI API; Codex subscription users should select
the explicit `gpt-5.6-sol` model instead. Tau tombstones the API-only alias for
the Codex provider, so older user catalog overlays and saved preferences cannot
restore it after an upgrade.

### OpenCode Go and Zen

OpenCode Go and OpenCode Zen are **API-key providers**, not OAuth providers.
Sign in at the OpenCode console, subscribe to Go or fund Zen, copy the API key,
and then run:

```text
/login opencode-go  # subscription limits; https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1
/login opencode     # Zen pay-as-you-go; https://opencode.ai/zen/v1
```

Both can also read `OPENCODE_API_KEY`. Tau stores their saved credentials under
separate `opencode-go` and `opencode` names, allowing different keys when
needed. Available models and plan limits change over time; consult the
[OpenCode Go](https://opencode.ai/docs/go) and
[OpenCode Zen](https://opencode.ai/docs/zen) pages for the current list.

### Hugging Face Inference Providers

Log in with `/login huggingface` or set `HF_TOKEN`. Tau's built-in Hugging Face
catalog includes 47 coding-capable models routed through
`https://router.huggingface.co/v1`, including DeepSeek, Gemma, GLM, GPT OSS,
Kimi, Llama, MiniMax, MiMo, Qwen, and Step families. This includes
`moonshotai/Kimi-K3`, with text and image input, a 1,048,576-token context
window, and `low`, `high`, and `max` reasoning effort. Tau exposes `max` as its
`xhigh` thinking level. Use `/model` to search the full list; model availability
and the inference provider selected by Hugging Face can vary over time and by
account.

For a new session without an explicit preference, Hugging Face initially routes
the model automatically. After the first successful response, Tau reads Hugging
Face's `x-inference-provider` response header and pins that backing provider for
the rest of the session. To choose the initial provider instead, add a per-model
`inference_providers` preference to `~/.tau/providers.json`:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 2,
  "default_provider": "huggingface",
  "provider_preferences": {
    "huggingface": {
      "default_model": "zai-org/GLM-5.2",
      "inference_providers": { "zai-org/GLM-5.2": "deepinfra" }
    }
  },
  "scoped_models": []
}
```

Use the exact provider suffix advertised for that model by Hugging Face. Tau
sends `zai-org/GLM-5.2:deepinfra` on the wire and continues to display and store
the logical `zai-org/GLM-5.2` model. The pin survives resume; changing the
preference does not rewrite existing sessions. `/session` shows the active pin.
Route selection is available through the external
[`alejandro-ao/tau-huggingface`](https://github.com/alejandro-ao/tau-huggingface)
extension rather than a built-in command. It requires Tau 0.3.10 or newer. Clone
and load it explicitly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alejandro-ao/tau-huggingface.git
tau -e ./tau-huggingface
```

Then use `/route <provider>` to select a route or `/route automatic` to reset
it. Switching models uses that model's configured pin or starts automatic
resolution again.

Transient failures retry on the same wire model, and stream failures are not
retried after model output has started. Pinning can reduce cold prefix-cache
misses caused by cross-provider routing, but cannot prevent eviction, TTL expiry,
or load balancing among workers within the chosen provider. Tau does not yet
fall back automatically from an unavailable pinned route: doing so also requires
a user-visible reroute event and durable reroute telemetry. Use the Hugging Face
extension or start a new automatic session to resolve another route. See
[Configuration]({{< relref "../reference/configuration.md#provider-preferences" >}}).

### Moonshot AI API vs. Kimi Code

Both Kimi providers authenticate requests with Bearer API keys; neither uses
OAuth. They are separate because the keys come from different consoles, use
different endpoints, and charge against different billing plans:

| Tau provider | Access and billing | Model | Endpoint | Environment variable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `moonshotai` | Pay-as-you-go key from the [Kimi Open Platform](https://platform.kimi.ai/console/api-keys) | `kimi-k2.7-code` | `https://api.moonshot.ai/v1` | `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` |
| `kimi-code` | Subscription key from the [Kimi Code console](https://www.kimi.com/code/console) | `k3` or rolling `kimi-for-coding` alias | `https://api.kimi.com/coding/v1` | `KIMI_CODE_API_KEY` |

Kimi K3 uses the `k3` model ID, accepts text and image input, and supports up to
a 1,048,576-token context window on eligible plans. It supports three
reasoning-effort levels via the `reasoning_effort` field: `low`, `high`, and
`max` (default). Tau exposes these as the `low`, `high`, and `xhigh` thinking
levels respectively, and starts new K3 sessions at `xhigh` unless a remembered
per-model choice exists. Start a new session when switching to K3 so the
previous model's context cache is not re-prefilled. See
[Kimi's model documentation](https://www.kimi.com/code/docs/en/kimi-code/models)
for current plan availability and context limits.

A key for one service should not be treated as interchangeable with a key for
the other. Tau stores them independently under the `moonshotai` and `kimi-code`
credential names, so `/login moonshotai` and `/login kimi-code` can configure
both at once. The distinct environment variable names provide the same
separation when credentials are supplied through the shell.

Credentials saved through `/login` live in `~/.tau/credentials.json` with
private `0600` permissions and atomic file replacement. The file is not
encrypted; protect your Tau home directory and do not share its contents. The custom-provider
flow asks for the provider name, display name, base URL, API-key environment
variable, default model, and API key; it writes the provider definition to
`~/.tau/catalog.toml` and runtime preferences to `~/.tau/providers.json`.

Check what's configured and how each provider will authenticate:

```bash
tau providers
```

## Managing saved credentials

Use these slash commands inside Tau:

```text
/login [provider]   # add or refresh a saved credential
/logout [provider]  # remove a saved credential
```

Saved credentials take precedence over environment variables. `/logout` only
edits saved credentials — it never touches your environment or `providers.json`.

{{% note title="OAuth troubleshooting" %}}
Browser login can fall back to a pasted redirect URL/code when the callback
port is unavailable or the browser runs on another machine. In that flow the
login screen copies the authorization URL to your clipboard and renders it as
a link, so paste or click it rather than selecting the wrapped text — a URL
reassembled by hand loses characters at the line breaks and the provider
rejects it. Copilot uses a device code instead: open the short verification
URL and enter the code shown beneath it. A denied or expired code requires a
new `/login`. If a Copilot model reports that it is unsupported, enable it in
Copilot Chat's model selector or ask your organization administrator;
provider/model access varies by plan and policy.

## Choosing and switching models

- **`/model`** — open the picker (lists models across configured providers;
  choosing one can switch the active provider too).
- **`tau -m <model>`** or **`tau --provider <name> -m <model>`** — choose at
  launch.
- **Ctrl+P** — cycle your *scoped* (favorite) models without opening the picker.
  Build the list with `/scoped-models`, or press `Space` on a model in the
  `/model` picker.

Tau validates the selected model against the active provider's configured model
list before creating or refreshing a runtime provider. This prevents accidental
provider/model mismatches, such as trying to send an API-only OpenAI model to the
separate `openai-codex` subscription provider.

When a switch crosses provider APIs, Tau compiles existing tool history for the
target provider. Provider-specific tool-call IDs are deterministically translated
to a portable format, with the same translated ID used for each call and result.
When compiling history for Anthropic, Tau also omits opaque reasoning signatures
created by other APIs. This lets a session continue after tools have run without
exposing users to provider validation errors or rewriting the saved JSONL history.

### Claude Opus 5

Tau supports Anthropic's `claude-opus-5` through the direct `anthropic`
provider. The model has a 1M-token context window, accepts text and images,
generates up to 128k tokens, and costs $5 / $25 per million input/output tokens.
Anthropic enables adaptive thinking by default. Tau maps its `low` through
`high` modes directly, maps `xhigh` to Anthropic's maximum effort, and sends an
explicit disabled-thinking request for `off`.

Use `/login anthropic-api` or `/login anthropic-subscription`, then select
**Claude Opus 5** in `/model`. See Anthropic's
[Claude Opus 5 guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/whats-new-opus-5)
for current behavior and availability.

## Adding a custom / local provider

Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works — including local servers like llama.cpp or
Ollama. The easiest interactive path is:

```text
/login custom
```

Tau prompts for the provider details, saves the API key, writes the provider
metadata to `~/.tau/catalog.toml`, and makes the provider available immediately.

### llama.cpp quickstart

Tau works with llama.cpp through its OpenAI-compatible server. Start a local
server with a GGUF model from Hugging Face:

```bash
llama-server -hf ggml-org/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-GGUF:Q8_0
```

Some installs expose the same server as `llama serve`:

```bash
llama serve -hf ggml-org/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-GGUF:Q8_0
```

Then register it with Tau:

```bash
export LLAMA_API_KEY=local # any non-empty value unless you started llama.cpp with --api-key

tau --provider llama-cpp \
  --base-url http://localhost:8080/v1 \
  --api-key-env LLAMA_API_KEY \
  --model local \
  setup
```

Run Tau against the local model:

```bash
tau --provider llama-cpp
tau --provider llama-cpp "summarize this project"    # TUI with an initial prompt
tau --provider llama-cpp -p "summarize this project" # one-shot print mode
```

`llama-server` listens on port `8080` by default and only enforces the bearer
token if you launch it with `--api-key`.

For scripted or one-off setup with another OpenAI-compatible server, use the
same `tau setup` flow. For example, Ollama's OpenAI-compatible endpoint usually
runs at `http://localhost:11434/v1`:

```bash
tau --provider local \
  --base-url http://localhost:11434/v1 \
  --api-key-env LOCAL_API_KEY \
  --model qwen \
  setup
```

This writes the provider definition to `~/.tau/catalog.toml`, writes runtime
preferences to `~/.tau/providers.json`, and (by default) makes it the default
provider.

For reusable provider definitions, add a user-level catalog overlay at
`~/.tau/catalog.toml`:

```toml
schema_version = 1

[[providers]]
name = "local-gateway"
display_name = "Local Gateway"
kind = "openai-compatible"
base_url = "http://localhost:11434/v1"
api_key_env = "LOCAL_GATEWAY_API_KEY"
credential_name = "local-gateway"
models = ["qwen-coder"]
default_model = "qwen-coder"
docs_url = "https://example.test/local-gateway"

[providers.context_windows]
qwen-coder = 64000
```

Tau loads its bundled `src/tau_coding/data/catalog.toml` first, then overlays
`~/.tau/catalog.toml`. A user entry with the same `name` can extend or override a
built-in provider: scalar fields replace built-in values, `models` are merged
with your models first, and `context_windows` are merged.

There is intentionally **no project-level** `.tau/catalog.toml`. Only the
user-level `~/.tau/catalog.toml` is loaded, so cloning a repository cannot
silently redirect a provider's `base_url` or credentials to an unexpected
service.

Run the custom provider with:

```bash
tau --provider local-gateway
tau --provider local-gateway "summarize this project"    # TUI with an initial prompt
tau --provider local-gateway -p "summarize this project" # one-shot print mode
```

Catalog TOML is for provider and model metadata. It does **not** accept runtime
request options such as custom HTTP headers, timeouts, or retry settings. Put
those in `~/.tau/providers.json` instead. Saved `providers.json` entries support
`headers`, `timeout_seconds`, `max_retries`, and `max_retry_delay_seconds`. For
the full JSON shape, the catalog TOML shape, and `thinking_levels` for custom
models, see [Configuration]({{< relref "../reference/configuration.md#providers" >}}).

{{% tip title="Hugging Face org billing" %}}
To send a Hugging Face billing header, keep the provider definition in the
catalog, then add the header to the matching provider preference in
`~/.tau/providers.json`:

```json
{
  "default_provider": "huggingface",
  "provider_preferences": {
    "huggingface": {
      "default_model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b",
      "headers": { "X-HF-Bill-To": "my-org" },
      "thinking_defaults": { "openai/gpt-oss-120b": "low" },
      "timeout_seconds": 60,
      "max_retries": 2,
      "max_retry_delay_seconds": 1
    }
  },
  "scoped_models": []
}
```
{{% /tip %}}

## How credentials are resolved

For a given provider, Tau uses, in order: a stored credential in
`~/.tau/credentials.json`, then the environment variable named by the provider's
`api_key_env`. OAuth credentials are refreshed immediately before a request and
the replacement is saved atomically. Use `/login` for built-in providers or
`/login custom` for OpenAI-compatible custom providers.

title: Providers & models
description: Connect OAuth subscriptions, API-key providers, or a local model — and switch models any time.
---

A **provider** is the service hosting AI models; a **model** is the specific one
you talk to. Tau ships with several built-in providers and lets you add your own
OpenAI-compatible endpoints (including local models).

## The fastest setup: `/login`

Start Tau and use `/login` to connect a provider. The provider picker includes
a search field, which is especially useful for the longer API-key provider list:

```bash
tau
```

```text
/login              # choose a login method
/login openai       # save an OpenAI API key
/login openai-codex # authenticate a Codex/ChatGPT subscription via OAuth
/login anthropic-subscription # authenticate Claude Pro/Max via OAuth
/login anthropic-api # save an Anthropic API key
/login github-copilot # authenticate GitHub Copilot with a device code
/login opencode-go  # save an OpenCode Go API key
/login nvidia       # save an NVIDIA NIM API key
/login custom       # add an OpenAI-compatible custom provider
```

Built-in providers include **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, **OpenAI Codex**
(subscription), **GitHub Copilot**, **OpenCode Go**, **OpenCode Zen**,
**Moonshot AI (Kimi)**, **Kimi Code** (subscription), **OpenRouter**, **Hugging Face**,
and **NVIDIA NIM**.

### OAuth subscriptions

Choose **Subscription / OAuth** in `/login` for:

| Tau provider | Login flow | Prerequisite |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `openai-codex` | Browser callback with pasted-code fallback | A supported ChatGPT/Codex subscription |
| `anthropic` | Browser callback with PKCE and pasted-code fallback | Claude Pro/Max with Anthropic extra usage available |
| `github-copilot` | GitHub device code | An active Copilot plan; organization policy must allow the selected model |

GitHub Copilot asks for a GitHub Enterprise Server URL/domain. Leave it blank
for `github.com`. Device login also works in SSH/headless sessions: open the
shown verification URL on any device and enter the displayed code.

Anthropic uses distinct direct-login aliases so the authentication method is
unambiguous: `/login anthropic-subscription` starts OAuth, while
`/login anthropic-api` saves an API key. The top-level `/login` picker still
lists Anthropic under both **Subscription / OAuth** and **API key**. OAuth
subscription requests use Anthropic's required
Claude Code identity and may be billed as extra usage rather than consuming
ordinary Claude plan limits. Check Anthropic's current account terms before
using it.

OAuth tokens refresh automatically. `/logout` removes Tau's local credential,
but does not revoke the grant remotely; use the provider's account settings for
remote revocation.

#### OpenAI prompt caching

For direct OpenAI API and Codex OAuth sessions, Tau sends a stable session-derived
prompt-cache key with every model request, including continuations after tool
calls. OpenAI can use that key to keep successive append-only requests on the same
cache path, improving reuse of the system prompt, tool schemas, and conversation
prefix. Resuming a Tau session reuses its key; starting or branching a session
creates a new one.

Requests remain stateless: Tau keeps provider storage disabled and resends the
complete transcript. The key improves cache affinity but cannot preserve a hit if
the prefix changes or the provider cache expires. OpenAI-compatible gateways do
not receive these fields unless their catalog compatibility settings explicitly
opt in. The TUI sidebar's latest-request cache rate shows whether the most recent
request actually hit.

#### Anthropic prompt caching

Tau marks cache breakpoints on Anthropic requests so the system prompt, tool
schemas, and conversation history are reused between turns instead of being
reprocessed. Which retention Tau asks for depends on how you authenticated:

- **Claude Pro/Max via OAuth** requests the one-hour cache. Subscription auth is
  not billed per token, and the five-minute default is shorter than a build, a
  test run, or the time it takes to read a diff — any of which would otherwise
  expire the cache mid-session.
- **An Anthropic API key** uses the five-minute default, because one-hour cache
  writes cost more per token and that should be a deliberate choice.

Providers that speak the Anthropic protocol through a gateway rather than being
Anthropic itself — `minimax`, `minimax-cn`, `fireworks`, and `vercel-ai-gateway` —
send no cache breakpoints, since not every gateway accepts them. Watch the
sidebar's cache hit rate to see caching working; see
[The interactive session]({{< relref "./tui.md" >}}) for how to read it.

#### Codex subscription context limits

OpenAI's public API and the ChatGPT/Codex subscription are separate serving
surfaces. A model with the same ID can have a smaller, rollout-specific context
window through Codex OAuth than through an API key. For example, the public
GPT-5.6 Sol API advertises a 1.05M-token window, while Codex has advertised
substantially smaller limits through its authenticated model catalog.

Tau queries that catalog when a Codex session starts and uses the returned
context window and automatic-compaction threshold for the session. If discovery
is unavailable, Tau falls back to conservative Codex-specific values from its
built-in catalog; it does not reuse the public API limit. `/session` reports both
the active value and whether it came from the live provider catalog or Tau's
configured fallback.

Live limits can vary by account or rollout and may change independently of Tau.
A discovery failure is non-fatal: Tau reports it in `/session` and continues with
the fallback. Direct OpenAI API sessions retain the context limits documented on
the API model page. Vision-capable Codex models retain their image-input
metadata separately from these runtime context limits, allowing image files read
by Tau to reach the model. The `gpt-5.6` alias, which routes to GPT-5.6 Sol, is only
available through the direct OpenAI API; Codex subscription users should select
the explicit `gpt-5.6-sol` model instead. Tau tombstones the API-only alias for
the Codex provider, so older user catalog overlays and saved preferences cannot
restore it after an upgrade.

### OpenCode Go and Zen

OpenCode Go and OpenCode Zen are **API-key providers**, not OAuth providers.
Sign in at the OpenCode console, subscribe to Go or fund Zen, copy the API key,
and then run:

```text
/login opencode-go  # subscription limits; https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1
/login opencode     # Zen pay-as-you-go; https://opencode.ai/zen/v1
```

Both can also read `OPENCODE_API_KEY`. Tau stores their saved credentials under
separate `opencode-go` and `opencode` names, allowing different keys when
needed. Available models and plan limits change over time; consult the
[OpenCode Go](https://opencode.ai/docs/go) and
[OpenCode Zen](https://opencode.ai/docs/zen) pages for the current list.

### Hugging Face Inference Providers

Log in with `/login huggingface` or set `HF_TOKEN`. Tau's Hugging Face model
list is generated at build time from [models.dev](https://models.dev) and routed
through `https://router.huggingface.co/v1`. It includes tool-capable models from
DeepSeek, Gemma, GLM, GPT OSS, Kimi, Llama, MiniMax, MiMo, Qwen, Step, and other
families. Use `/model` to search the generated list; availability and the backing
inference provider can vary over time and by account.

Like Pi, Tau's released snapshot includes model names, limits, costs, modalities,
reasoning support, and verified effort values. Thinking levels are `off`,
`minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max`; `max` is distinct from
`xhigh`. Empty or toggle-only reasoning options do not replace provider/manual
behavior. Hugging Face `zai-org/GLM-5.2` currently uses a narrow verified
correction exposing `off`, `high`, and `max`, so Tau never sends its unsupported
`medium` value. A bundled snapshot keeps startup offline. Opening `/model`
refreshes catalogs in the background and caches them in
`~/.tau/models-store.json`; run `tau update --models` to force revalidation.
New models and capability changes can therefore arrive without upgrading Tau.
Set `TAU_OFFLINE=1` to use cached/bundled data without catalog network access.

For a new session without an explicit preference, Hugging Face initially routes
the model automatically. After the first successful response, Tau reads Hugging
Face's `x-inference-provider` response header and keeps that backing provider as
a sticky automatic route. If that route later exhausts its normal retries with a
retryable HTTP failure before producing output, Tau retries the interrupted turn
once through unsuffixed automatic routing and makes the successful replacement
the new sticky route. To choose a fixed provider instead, add a per-model
`inference_providers` preference to `~/.tau/providers.json`:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 2,
  "default_provider": "huggingface",
  "provider_preferences": {
    "huggingface": {
      "default_model": "zai-org/GLM-5.2",
      "inference_providers": { "zai-org/GLM-5.2": "deepinfra" }
    }
  },
  "scoped_models": []
}
```

Use the exact provider suffix advertised for that model by Hugging Face. Tau
sends `zai-org/GLM-5.2:deepinfra` on the wire and continues to display and store
the logical `zai-org/GLM-5.2` model. The pin survives resume; changing the
preference does not rewrite existing sessions. `/session` shows the active pin.
Route selection is available through the external
[`alejandro-ao/tau-huggingface`](https://github.com/alejandro-ao/tau-huggingface)
extension rather than a built-in command. It requires Tau 0.3.10 or newer. Clone
and load it explicitly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alejandro-ao/tau-huggingface.git
tau -e ./tau-huggingface
```

Then use `/hf route` to pick from the model's currently live routes,
`/hf route <provider>` to select a fixed route, or `/hf route automatic` to
return to recoverable automatic routing. Switching models uses that model's
configured fixed route or starts automatic resolution again. `/session` reports
`automatic (currently <provider>)` for a sticky automatic route and
`<provider> (fixed)` for an explicit route.

Transient failures first retry on the same wire model, and stream failures are
not retried or rerouted after model output has started. After those retries are
exhausted, only sticky routes selected in automatic mode fail over; routes chosen
through `/hf route <provider>` or the `inference_providers` preference remain
fixed so Tau never overrides explicit user intent. Automatic failover emits
visible retry progress and durable provider diagnostics. Pinning can reduce cold
prefix-cache misses caused by cross-provider routing, but cannot prevent eviction,
TTL expiry, or load balancing among workers within the chosen provider. A reroute
may require a cold prefix prefill, and account-wide rate limits may still fail on
the automatic retry. See
[Configuration]({{< relref "../reference/configuration.md#provider-preferences" >}}).

### Moonshot AI API vs. Kimi Code

Both Kimi providers authenticate requests with Bearer API keys; neither uses
OAuth. They are separate because the keys come from different consoles, use
different endpoints, and charge against different billing plans:

| Tau provider | Access and billing | Model | Endpoint | Environment variable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `moonshotai` | Pay-as-you-go key from the [Kimi Open Platform](https://platform.kimi.ai/console/api-keys) | `kimi-k2.7-code` | `https://api.moonshot.ai/v1` | `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` |
| `kimi-code` | Subscription key from the [Kimi Code console](https://www.kimi.com/code/console) | `k3` or rolling `kimi-for-coding` alias | `https://api.kimi.com/coding/v1` | `KIMI_CODE_API_KEY` |

Kimi K3 uses the `k3` model ID, accepts text and image input, and supports up to
a 1,048,576-token context window on eligible plans. It supports three
reasoning-effort levels via the `reasoning_effort` field: `low`, `high`, and
`max` (default). Tau exposes these as the distinct `low`, `high`, and `max`
thinking levels, and starts new K3 sessions at `max` unless a remembered
per-model choice exists. Start a new session when switching to K3 so the
previous model's context cache is not re-prefilled. See
[Kimi's model documentation](https://www.kimi.com/code/docs/en/kimi-code/models)
for current plan availability and context limits.

A key for one service should not be treated as interchangeable with a key for
the other. Tau stores them independently under the `moonshotai` and `kimi-code`
credential names, so `/login moonshotai` and `/login kimi-code` can configure
both at once. The distinct environment variable names provide the same
separation when credentials are supplied through the shell.

Credentials saved through `/login` live in `~/.tau/credentials.json` with
private `0600` permissions and atomic file replacement. The file is not
encrypted; protect your Tau home directory and do not share its contents. The custom-provider
flow asks for the provider name, display name, base URL, API-key environment
variable, default model, and API key; it writes the provider definition to
`~/.tau/catalog.toml` and runtime preferences to `~/.tau/providers.json`.

Check what's configured and how each provider will authenticate:

```bash
tau providers
```

## Managing saved credentials

Use these slash commands inside Tau:

```text
/login [provider]   # add or refresh a saved credential
/logout [provider]  # remove a saved credential
```

Saved credentials take precedence over environment variables. `/logout` only
edits saved credentials — it never touches your environment or `providers.json`.

{{% note title="OAuth troubleshooting" %}}
Browser login can fall back to a pasted redirect URL/code when the callback
port is unavailable or the browser runs on another machine. In that flow the
login screen copies the authorization URL to your clipboard and renders it as
a link, so paste or click it rather than selecting the wrapped text — a URL
reassembled by hand loses characters at the line breaks and the provider
rejects it. Copilot uses a device code instead: open the short verification
URL and enter the code shown beneath it. A denied or expired code requires a
new `/login`. If a Copilot model reports that it is unsupported, enable it in
Copilot Chat's model selector or ask your organization administrator;
provider/model access varies by plan and policy.

## Choosing and switching models

- **`/model`** — open the picker (lists models across configured providers;
  choosing one can switch the active provider too).
- **`tau -m <model>`** or **`tau --provider <name> -m <model>`** — choose at
  launch.
- **Ctrl+P** — cycle your *scoped* (favorite) models without opening the picker.
  Build the list with `/scoped-models`, or press `Space` on a model in the
  `/model` picker.

Tau validates the selected model against the active provider's configured model
list before creating or refreshing a runtime provider. This prevents accidental
provider/model mismatches, such as trying to send an API-only OpenAI model to the
separate `openai-codex` subscription provider.

When a switch crosses provider APIs, Tau compiles existing tool history for the
target provider. Provider-specific tool-call IDs are deterministically translated
to a portable format, with the same translated ID used for each call and result.
When compiling history for Anthropic, Tau also omits opaque reasoning signatures
created by other APIs. This lets a session continue after tools have run without
exposing users to provider validation errors or rewriting the saved JSONL history.

### Claude Opus 5

Tau supports Anthropic's `claude-opus-5` through the direct `anthropic`
provider. The model has a 1M-token context window, accepts text and images,
generates up to 128k tokens, and costs $5 / $25 per million input/output tokens.
Anthropic enables adaptive thinking by default. Tau exposes models.dev's
verified `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max` efforts as distinct modes.

Use `/login anthropic-api` or `/login anthropic-subscription`, then select
**Claude Opus 5** in `/model`. See Anthropic's
[Claude Opus 5 guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/whats-new-opus-5)
for current behavior and availability.

## Dynamic extension providers

Tau's extension API has a process-local `DynamicProvider` contract validated
by a permanent second fake backend and a test-only Ollama adapter. Unlike
providers created by `/login custom` or `tau setup`, these definitions are
source/generation-owned overlays and are never copied into `catalog.toml`,
`providers.json`, sessions, or generic disk storage. Source ownership is a stable
host identity derived from the canonical extension entry path—not the display
name. Tau freezes every discovered identity before importing extension code, so
symlink retargeting cannot change registration or cleanup ownership; separate
same-name extension files cannot remove one another's providers. They support
dormant model sets, deeply immutable compatibility metadata, atomic
model-snapshot refresh, per-caller refresh deadlines, retry-safe coalescing, and
required/optional/no authentication without fake keys or exposed auth provenance.
Custom auth-resolution exceptions are reduced to a categorical host error during
runtime creation; Tau's required-key guidance remains actionable.

Phase 1 established the contracts and registry mechanics. The `/local` host now
provides the generic TUI flow for registered dynamic local backends. Dynamic
providers still do not become durable catalog entries or automatic startup
fallbacks: configure a backend, then choose its provider/model explicitly. The
trusted built-in llama.cpp provider is the narrow scoped-model exception: Tau
may persist only its stable provider ID plus exact model ID. An unloaded/stale
reference remains visible as unavailable and cannot trigger load or download.
User and project dynamic providers cannot opt into durable references. See
the [local backends guide]({{< relref "./local-inference.md" >}}) and
[Extensions]({{< relref "./extensions.md#dynamic-providers" >}}).

## Adding a custom / local provider

Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works — including local servers like llama.cpp or
Ollama. The easiest interactive path is:

```text
/login custom
```

Tau prompts for the provider details, saves the API key, writes the provider
metadata to `~/.tau/catalog.toml`, and makes the provider available immediately.

### Built-in llama.cpp backend

Tau's first-class llama.cpp integration is configured through the provider-neutral
`/local` command. For download/load/unload management, start llama.cpp
independently in router mode without a model argument:

```bash
llama-server --models-max 1 --parallel 1 --flash-attn auto
```

See the [official router guide](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/tools/server/README.md#using-multiple-models)
and Tau's complete guide below before adding hardware- or model-specific flags.

Then open Tau and run:

```text
/local
```

Choose and confirm the recommended `llama.cpp` backend. Tau automatically
checks the saved, environment, or default endpoint; use **Configure** for a
server elsewhere and an optional API key. Tau discovers exact loaded model IDs
through OpenAI-compatible or compatible router discovery; it does not use a
fake key or fake model. Compatible b9688–b10595 routers show arrow-key
navigable model states plus explicitly confirmed load, unload, Hugging Face GGUF
search, and server-side download actions. Load/download confirmations preselect
Cancel as an unlabelled safety default. Closing `/local` leaves an active
server-side download running; reopen it to cancel explicitly. No key means no
`Authorization` header. A saved key takes precedence over `LLAMA_API_KEY`.

Use the discovered ID explicitly from the TUI or print mode:

```bash
tau --provider llama.cpp --model <model-id>
tau --provider llama.cpp --model <model-id> --print "summarize this project"
```

The configured endpoint and safe model snapshot are stored under
`~/.tau/state/extensions/llama.cpp.json`; secrets stay in the credential store.
A cached snapshot allows explicit startup during temporary server downtime.
`/local` never scans ports or processes, stops the external server, or deletes
model files. See the [complete llama.cpp guide]({{< relref "./local-inference.md" >}})
for endpoint precedence, Doctor, reset, and troubleshooting.

An older manually configured provider named `llama-cpp` remains separate and is
not migrated. Configure the built-in `llama.cpp` layer through `/local`, and use
the custom-provider flow below for Ollama and other OpenAI-compatible servers.
Tau does not ship an Ollama backend.

For scripted or one-off setup with another OpenAI-compatible server, use the
same `tau setup` flow. For example, Ollama's OpenAI-compatible endpoint usually
runs at `http://localhost:11434/v1`:

```bash
tau --provider local \
  --base-url http://localhost:11434/v1 \
  --api-key-env LOCAL_API_KEY \
  --model qwen \
  setup
```

This writes the provider definition to `~/.tau/catalog.toml`, writes runtime
preferences to `~/.tau/providers.json`, and (by default) makes it the default
provider.

For reusable provider definitions, add a user-level catalog overlay at
`~/.tau/catalog.toml`:

```toml
schema_version = 1

[[providers]]
name = "local-gateway"
display_name = "Local Gateway"
kind = "openai-compatible"
base_url = "http://localhost:11434/v1"
api_key_env = "LOCAL_GATEWAY_API_KEY"
credential_name = "local-gateway"
models = ["qwen-coder"]
default_model = "qwen-coder"
docs_url = "https://example.test/local-gateway"

[providers.context_windows]
qwen-coder = 64000
```

Tau loads its bundled `src/tau_coding/data/catalog.toml` first, then overlays
`~/.tau/catalog.toml`. A user entry with the same `name` can extend or override a
built-in provider: scalar fields replace built-in values, `models` are merged
with your models first, and `context_windows` are merged.

There is intentionally **no project-level** `.tau/catalog.toml`. Only the
user-level `~/.tau/catalog.toml` is loaded, so cloning a repository cannot
silently redirect a provider's `base_url` or credentials to an unexpected
service.

Run the custom provider with:

```bash
tau --provider local-gateway
tau --provider local-gateway "summarize this project"    # TUI with an initial prompt
tau --provider local-gateway -p "summarize this project" # one-shot print mode
```

Catalog TOML is for provider and model metadata. It does **not** accept runtime
request options such as custom HTTP headers, timeouts, or retry settings. Put
those in `~/.tau/providers.json` instead. Saved `providers.json` entries support
`headers`, `timeout_seconds`, `max_retries`, and `max_retry_delay_seconds`. For
the full JSON shape, the catalog TOML shape, and `thinking_levels` for custom
models, see [Configuration]({{< relref "../reference/configuration.md#providers" >}}).

{{% tip title="Hugging Face org billing" %}}
To send a Hugging Face billing header, keep the provider definition in the
catalog, then add the header to the matching provider preference in
`~/.tau/providers.json`:

```json
{
  "default_provider": "huggingface",
  "provider_preferences": {
    "huggingface": {
      "default_model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b",
      "headers": { "X-HF-Bill-To": "my-org" },
      "thinking_defaults": { "openai/gpt-oss-120b": "low" },
      "timeout_seconds": 60,
      "max_retries": 2,
      "max_retry_delay_seconds": 1
    }
  },
  "scoped_models": []
}
```
{{% /tip %}}

## How credentials are resolved

For a given provider, Tau uses, in order: a stored credential in
`~/.tau/credentials.json`, then the environment variable named by the provider's
`api_key_env`. OAuth credentials are refreshed immediately before a request and
the replacement is saved atomically. Use `/login` for built-in providers or
`/login custom` for OpenAI-compatible custom providers.

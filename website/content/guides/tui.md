description: Get fluent in Tau's terminal UI — prompting, steering, the command palette, tool output, and pickers.
---

Running `tau` with no arguments opens the interactive terminal UI (TUI). This is
where most work happens. This guide covers the moving parts; for the exact keys
see [Keyboard shortcuts]({{< relref "../reference/keybindings.md" >}}).

## Sending a prompt

Type into the prompt box at the bottom and press **Enter** to submit. The editor
keeps its padded block size and background, while a single left border changes
color to reflect focus, shell mode, and active runs without boxing it in.
**Shift+Enter** inserts a newline for multi-line prompts. Tau streams the
assistant's reply above the prompt, showing tool calls as they run. In supported
terminal emulators, Tau also updates the tab title: named sessions show as
`τ | <name>`, and active runs add an animated running indicator so you can see
work continuing from another tab. When a run fully settles while Tau's terminal
surface is unfocused, Tau emits a desktop notification by default on supported
terminals: OSC 9 for Ghostty, iTerm2, and MinTTY, and OSC 99 for Kitty. Unknown
terminals are left untouched. Set `turn_notification` to `"bell"` to let the
terminal mark the tab or apply its configured bell behavior instead, or `"off"`
to disable notifications. BEL and operating-system desktop notifications may
produce sounds according to the user's terminal and system settings; see
[Configuration]({{< relref "../reference/configuration.md#tui-settings" >}}).

Clicking anywhere in the window returns focus to the prompt, so you can scroll
the transcript and keep typing without tabbing back.

If a provider request fails after retries, Tau shows the failure as an explicit
error block in the transcript, using the provider's own error message (for
example `server_is_overloaded` details instead of a generic failure). The block
includes a diagnostic log path and a reminder that the run ended. You can submit
another prompt without starting a new session; empty failed provider turns are
retained for diagnostics but are not replayed to the model as invalid
conversation history.

## Cancelling and steering a run

While the agent is working you don't have to wait:

- **Esc** cancels the active run. Cancellation is treated as an intentional stop,
  not an error.
- **Enter** (while running) queues your text as **steering** — extra guidance
  applied to the current run.
- **Alt+Enter** queues a **follow-up** — a prompt that waits until the current
  run would otherwise finish.
- Press **Up** on an empty prompt while running to pull the most recently queued
  follow-up back into the prompt for editing.

## The command palette and slash commands

In-session commands start with `/`. Open the **command palette** with **Ctrl+K**
to search and run them. Common ones:

- `/session` — show model, tools, skills, and context usage for the session. Text selected in this modal is copied to the clipboard automatically.
- `/model` — pick the active model
- `/tools` — search active tools by origin and open their full descriptions
- `/compact` — summarize and shrink the context
- `/resume`, `/tree` — open previous sessions or branch from history
- `/prompts` — search prompt templates and insert one for editing
- `/hotkeys` — show the keyboard shortcuts

The full list is in the [Slash commands reference]({{< relref "../reference/slash-commands.md" >}}).

## Running shell commands directly

You can run a shell command yourself without asking the model:

- `!<command>` runs it in the session's working directory **and** records the
  command and output in the conversation context.
- `!!<command>` runs it and shows the output **without** adding it to context.

As soon as the input starts with `!`, the whole input and its left border turn
the same amber/orange color as a tool while it is running, and the `τ` prompt
prefix becomes a matching `$`, so you can tell at a glance that submitting will
execute a shell command instead of messaging the model.

While typing a path after `!`/`!!`, press **Tab** to complete filenames from the
working directory. Dot-prefixed paths such as `.env` and `.agents/` are included.

{{% note title="Aliases" %}}
These commands (and the agent's `bash` tool) run in a non-interactive shell, so
your `~/.zshrc`/`~/.bashrc` aliases aren't loaded automatically. To use your own
aliases, set a `shellCommandPrefix` — see
[Shell settings]({{< relref "../reference/configuration.md#shell-settings" >}}).
{{% /note %}}

## Referencing files with `@`

Type `@` in the prompt to open file suggestions from the project tree, and insert
a path like `@src/app.py`. Use an explicit parent-relative path such as `@../` to
complete files and directories outside the project root. External completion
follows only the path you type instead of scanning the surrounding filesystem.
Dot-prefixed content such as `.env` and `.agents/` is included. Tau still skips
known metadata and generated directories such as `.git`, `.venv`, `node_modules`,
`__pycache__`, `build`, and `dist`.

## Dropping files into the prompt

Drag one or more files from your file manager onto the terminal window and Tau
inserts their filesystem paths into the prompt at the cursor, separated by
spaces. Paths that contain spaces are quoted automatically, and any text you
already typed is preserved. This works anywhere over the TUI, not just above
the input box, because the terminal delivers the drop as text input.

Drops are also accepted from sources that do not give the terminal keyboard focus
first, such as the macOS Dock's Downloads stack.

## Tool output

Tool calls keep a static marker in the transcript while they run: orange means
in progress, green means success, and red means failure. The prompt-area activity
indicator provides the run-wide animation without adding a second spinner to each
tool row.

Tool results (like long `read` or `bash` output) render as compact previews so
the transcript stays readable. Toggle full tool output with **Ctrl+O**. Markdown
link hover styling underlines only the linked text, never the rest of its row. User
message blocks use the same theme background as the prompt field and sidebar,
with light vertical padding so they read as blocks rather than highlighted lines.
This visually ties submitted prompts to the composer.

## Long sessions

Tau keeps long transcripts responsive by mounting only a window of messages in
the terminal at once. Your complete session remains in display state and durable
history. When older or newer messages are outside the current window, a small
boundary row appears; keep scrolling toward it to page through the rest of the
conversation.

Paging does not summarize, delete, or compact context. Use `/compact` separately
when you want to reduce what is sent to the model.

## Picking models and themes

- **`/model`** opens the model picker. Selecting a model from another provider
  switches the active provider too.
- **Ctrl+P** quickly cycles through your *scoped* (favorite) models without
  opening the picker. Manage that list with `/scoped-models` or by pressing
  `Space` on a model in the `/model` picker.
- **`/theme`** switches between `tau-dark`, `tau-light`, `high-contrast`, and
  any custom themes you have installed. Each theme uses one shared selection
  palette for prompt autocomplete and modal lists such as `/resume`. In
  `tau-dark`, the aqua selection color is also the global accent used for
  headings, prompt activity, and other emphasized UI. `tau-light` uses a deep
  teal accent for headings and list markers against its white background. See
  [Themes]({{< relref "./themes.md" >}}).

## The sidebar

On wide-enough terminals Tau shows the session name prominently without a
redundant section label, followed by active-branch
turn and tool-call totals, provider-reported token usage, latest-request and
session prompt-cache hit rates, estimated cost, automatic-compaction threshold,
and loaded tools, skills, prompt templates, extensions, and context files such as
`AGENTS.md`. Tool, prompt, and extension
names use compact comma-separated lists limited to three rendered lines. Skills
and context files use bullet lists, with one item or path per line, limited to
five entries. Truncated sections end with `...(X more)` showing how many entries
are hidden. Project context paths are relative to the working directory; context
loaded from the home directory starts with `~/`, while other context loaded from
outside the project uses its full path.

The wider, borderless sidebar uses the prompt field's background color, bright
section headings, quieter gray values, and keeps Tau's versioned `τ = 2π` mark
pinned to its bottom edge. Tau does not render separate
top-header or shortcut-footer rows. Named sessions remain visible in the sidebar
and terminal tab title; `/hotkeys` lists shortcuts when needed. The sidebar hides
automatically when the terminal is small, while the tab title continues to
identify the session.

Cumulative usage and cost cover the active branch, including history replaced by
compaction. Input usage counts tokens processed on every
provider request, so it can be much larger than the context used by the next
request. Cost is an estimate based on provider-reported usage and configured
catalog rates; the sidebar shows `$N/A` when Tau lacks complete pricing data.

The cache line separates the latest model request from the cumulative session.
Both rates are the share of prompt tokens the provider served from its cache
instead of processing again. The latest rate makes a cache miss immediately visible and,
after tool use, describes the most recent model continuation. The session rate
includes every request on the active branch, including the initial cold request.
A low latest rate usually means something early in the request changed, such as
a reloaded tool list or thinking level, or that a pause outlived the provider's
cache.
Tau hides both figures for providers that do not report cache usage.

The compact status block below the prompt puts `provider:model (thinking)` on its
first line and provider-anchored active context as `used/limit` on the second. When
no valid provider usage exists yet, such as immediately after compaction, it shows
`?/limit` until a fresh response reports usage. Unlike cumulative usage, this
active count describes the system prompt, tools,
and active messages Tau expects to send on the next request. It can decrease
after compaction while cumulative usage continues to increase. The
working-directory name and model are emphasized while the parent path, Git
branch, and provider use the quieter metadata color.

The sidebar appears on the **right** by default. It can be moved to the **left**
or turned **off** entirely by setting `sidebar_position` in `~/.tau/tui.json` —
see [Configuration]({{< relref "../reference/configuration.md#tui-settings" >}}).
